<div>div 1. Divs are static by default.</div>
<div>div 2. These divs have a padding of 5px (inside) and margin of 5px (outside.)</div>
<div>div 3</div>
<p id="origin_relative">.</p>
    <div class="relative">div 4 is relative, offset 10px from the top and 10px from the right. The offset origin, or starting point<br> <span style = "color:red;">(red dot)</span> is where the upper left corner from where it normally lies in the flow of the document.</div>
<div>div 5 is static</div>
<div>div 6 is static</div>
<p id="origin_absolute">.</p>
<div class="absolute">div 7 is absolute, offset 300px from the top and 300px from the left. Its offset origin <span style = "color:blue;">(blue dot)</span> is the top left corner of the page. In positioning, all other elements ignore the absolute element, and the absolute element ignores all the others.</div>
<div class="fixed">div 8 is fixed position, offset 100px from the top and 200px from the left. Fixed elements functions the same as absolute, the only difference is that fixed elements do not move on scroll.</div>
<div class="float">div 9 is float left, which means that all elements after it will move to the right rather than below.</div>
<div class="float">div 10 is float left.</div>
<div class="float">div 11 is float left.</div>
<div class="clear">div 12 is clear both, which takes it out of the floating flow.</div>
<div class="parent">div 13 is parent to div 14.
    <div class="child">div 14</div>
